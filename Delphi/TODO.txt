general

- alle ContextString(csVersion): SelfVersion

- common BaseXxmContest (virtual SendRaw)

- XxmProjectUnload

- LastModified: toch bias! (uur minder dan IIS)

- Context.URLPath
- Context.Priority (linked to thread priority!)
- set-cookie2 support
- context: settings from registry (e.g. connectionstring?)
- registration editor
- exception handling pages (500,400, TXxmHandler=class(TXxmPage) en setting)
- response timeout (how to halt a running thread?)
- document.browser

- some good solution for common xxm.pas and xxmFReg.pas units

- relative includes

- reg: ShellNew? tried but didn't work
- logging?

- XMLHTTP starts new session: test with authentication! (take-over other SessionID?)

Conv
- increment build version? (how to edit .res?)
- revise 'entry', directory or xxmp required
- flags
- signature on proto files?
- default proto in resources?
- (hidden dir 'dcu' maken?)
- '_proto' per directory zelfs?
- whitespace voor [[ ook overnemen
- create new project (can't get ShellNew to work!)
- CreateProcessWithLogin for compile?
- web.xxmp signature in TWebProject (not TProjectCacheEntry)
- dynamic list of supported exceptions, default pas,xxm,xxmi (act; proto, unit, res?)
- support a respurces file (zlib?) and auto update (using extension list?)

ISAPI
- keep-connection, chunked
- authentication?
- custom errors?
- reg: <ModulePath> relative to something? (combinepath?)
- compile-time user (runas)
- IP(range) to show compile log to
- check project cache cleanup code

http
- logging
- keep-connection, chunked

local
- bug: .log files? (mime type)
- CritSection in loader, not context (saves on resources)
- fix directory traversal to fire on //page.xxm//
- error/builderror response codes from registry (default 500?)
- if xxl in same dir, reg and run
- projects: smarter indexing?
- store to cache file
- history by xxm project
- register project: worn overwriting registration

idea's
- cascaded loading of xxl's
- limit threads per session
- GetParameter supporting ContextString enum
- 401 auth & windows auth (IHttpAuthenticate on local?)
- add files into rc for dll/xxl (tlb?)
- buffering?
- XML whitespace sanitation
- bpg support? (to what purpose?)
- separate unit for exceptions?
- include from other projects?
- line for line: xxm header rigged 20 lines, then pas line per xxm line?
- isapi: extra unit to make xxl an extension on its own
- isapi: need rebuild? rebuild and redirect to same page
- translatepath refactor into context
- force trailing "," on "[[@ ]]"
- create src dir hidden (difficult, since using ForceDirectories now)
- Context.Include resolve to delphi-name to have compile-time error?
- virtual directories (getlocalfilepath?)

minor issues
- xxm.pas: version from resource?

- tip: include: raise on caller=nil
