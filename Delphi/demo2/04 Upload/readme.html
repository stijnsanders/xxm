<dt>files\</dt>
<dd>Directory uploaded files will be stored in. <b>Attention:</b> storing uploaded files within a directory of the website poses a security risk, especially when sensitive information is passed between pages using client side scripting.</dd>
<dt>Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>The website's default page. It displays a list of the files that have already been uploaded, and a link to the upload form.</dd>
<dt>fAdd.xxm</dt>
<dd>The upload form. Please note the form's <code>method</code> and <code>enctype</code>, and the client-side script that grays the submit button, as a visual feedback that the form posting is in progress, and to prevent subsequent posts. (Some people confuse single and double click sometimes. Sometimes a second click happens unintentionally.)</dd>
<dt>aAdd.xxm</dt>
<dd>Accepts the upload form post. Expects a parameter that supports the <code>IXxmParameterPostFile</code> interface, and stores the uploaded file.</dd>
