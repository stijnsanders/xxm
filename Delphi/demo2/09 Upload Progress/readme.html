<h3>xxm Demo Projects - 09 Upload Progress</h3>
<p>This is a demo project showing how show the progress of large file uploads.</p>
<p style="background-color:gold;"><b>Important:</b> Some website-platforms use multiple processes to host a website.
Since this demonstration project uses a single TObjectList object to store session data,
the processes won't be able to access eachother's session data in this case, which results in unexpected behavior.<br />
For advanced projects it is strongly advised to use a central session object store (e.g.: a database, COM or COM+ server),
or to disable multiple processes (IIS: limit to 1 worker processes, Apache: single-process mode "-X")</p>

A session is needed to link incoming file uploads with requests to query the upload progress.</dd>
