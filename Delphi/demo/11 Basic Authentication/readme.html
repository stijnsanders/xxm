<h3>xxm Demo Projects - 11 Basic Authentication</h3>
<p>This is a demo project showing how to protect one or more pages with a plain username and password.</p>
<p style="background-color:gold;padding:0.4em;"><b>Attention:</b> This method doesn't apply a high level of security. Username and password combination is transmitted in the HTTP meta-data, and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore it's advisable to force the client to use HTTPS, but even so if you want proper security you should look into proper authentication on the server level by dedicated security infrastructure.</p>
