<h3>xxm Demo Projects - 04 Upload</h3>
<p>This is a demo project showing how to accept file uploads.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Web.xxmp</dt>
<dd>The project file, contains an internal list of the files of the project, and other data about the project.<br />
Use <i>xxmProject.exe</i> to edit and manage project settings.</dd>
<dt>xxmp.pas</dt>
<dd>The project's main unit. When this file is missing form the project, xxm creates one for you.</dd>
<dt>iHead.xxmi</dt>
<dd>An include file for pages to use with the HTML header</dd>
<dt>iFoot.xxmi</dt>
<dd>An include file for pages to use with the HTML footer</dd>
<dt>demo4.css</dt>
<dd>The website's style sheet, linked to by <code>iHead.xxmi</code>, and thus by any page that includes <code>iHead.xxmi</code>.</dd>
<dt>files\</dt>
<dd>Directory uploaded files will be stored in. <b>Attention:</b> storing uploaded files within a directory of the website poses a security risk, especially when sensitive information is passed between pages using client side scripting.</dd>
<dt>Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>The website's default page. It displays a list of the files that have already been uploaded, and a link to the upload form.</dd>
<dt>fAdd.xxm</dt>
<dd>The upload form. Please note the form's <code>method</code> and <code>enctype</code>, and the client-side script that grays the submit button, as a visual feedback that the form posting is in progress, and to prevent subsequent posts. (Some people confuse single and double click sometimes. Sometimes a second click happens unintentionally.)</dd>
<dt>aAdd.xxm</dt>
<dd>Accepts the upload form post. Expects a parameter that supports the <code>IXxmParameterPostFile</code> interface, and stores the uploaded file.</dd>
<dt>fMulti.xxm</dt>
<dd>An upload form that allows selecting multiple files. Please note the similarity to <code>fAdd.xxm</code>, but with an added <code>multiple</code> attribute.</dd>
<dt>aMulti.xxm</dt>
<dd>Accepts the upload form post. Uses <code>IXxmParameter</code>'s <code>NextBySameName</code> method to process all incoming files.</dd>
