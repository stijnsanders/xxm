<h3>xxm Demo Projects - 08 Cross Project Includes</h3>
<p>This is a demo project showing how to include a fragment from another project.
This demonstration has a main project and two sub-projects,
each with a fragment that displays the counter,
decreases it by one and passes it to the fragment of the other sub-project until the counter reaches zero.
This also demonstrates re-including fragments from a project that has already been included will not deadlock.
(Auto-build/auto-update is limited to the first include for each project called for cross-project including.)</p>
<p>To set up this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Register Web.xxmp with an xxm handler (e.g. xxmLocalDev.dll)</li>
<li>Register sub1\Web.xxmp with an xxm handler</li>
<li>Register sub2\Web.xxmp with an xxm handler</li>
<li>Set AllowInclude=1 on all three project registries (in the Windows registry or xxm.xml)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Web.xxmp</dt>
<dd>The project file, contains an internal list of the files of the project, and other data about the project.</dd>
<dt>xxmp.pas</dt>
<dd>The project's main unit. When this file is missing form the project, xxm creates one for you.</dd>
<dt>Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>The website's default page. It calls A.xxmi in project sub1 with a selected counter value.</dd>
<dt>sub1\Web.xxmp</dt>
<dd>The project file for project 'sub1'</dd>
<dt>sub1\Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>A start page for project 'sub1'</dd>
<dt>sub1\A.xxmi</dt>
<dd>A fragment that displays a counter, decrements it and passes it to A.xxmi in project 'sub2' if the counter has not reached zero.</dd>
<dt>sub2\Web.xxmp</dt>
<dd>The project file for project 'sub2'</dd>
<dt>sub2\Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>A start page for project 'sub2'</dd>
<dt>sub2\A.xxmi</dt>
<dd>A fragment that displays a counter, decrements it and passes it to A.xxmi in project 'sub1' if the counter has not reached zero.</dd>
</dl>
