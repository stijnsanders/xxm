<h3>xxm Demo Projects - 02 Session</h3>
<p>This is a demo project showing how to set up basic session management in a xxm project.</p>
<p style="background-color:gold;padding:0.4em;"><b>Important:</b> Some website-platforms use multiple processes to host a website.
Since this demonstration project uses a single array to store session data using the sorted SessionID's,
the processes won't be able to access eachother's session data in this case, which results in unexpected behavior.<br />
For advanced projects it is strongly advised to use a central session object store (e.g.: a database, COM or COM+ server),
or to disable multiple processes (IIS: limit to 1 worker processes, Apache: single-process mode "-X")</p>
<dl>
<dt>Web.xxmp</dt>
<dd>The project file, contains an internal list of the files of the project, and other data about the project.<br />
Use <i>xxmProject.exe</i> to edit and manage project settings.</dd>
<dt>Default.xxm</dt>
<dd>The website's default page. It shows either a login-form or a logout button, depending on wether you're logged in or not.</dd>
<dt>xxmp2.pas</dt>
<dd>The project's main unit. When this file is missing form the project, xxm creates one for you.<br />
This one has been modified to include the <code>SetSession(Context);</code> call in <code>function XxmPage</code>, linking each request to a new or existing session object.</dd>
<dt>xxmSession.pas</dt>
<dd>This unit defines the TxxmSession class, and SetSession and AbandonSession procedures.<br />
It also uses a SessionStore array to keep a track of started sessions and clean them up when the project shuts down.<br />
SetSession uses CxxmContext's SessionID property to uniquely identify the visitor (e.b. by using a cookie).</dd>
<dt>Login.xxm</dt>
<dd>The logon form posts here. It only checks if you entered a name, and if so flags the session as authenticated. Other websites could check the entered password here.</dd>
<dt>Logout.xxm</dt>
<dd>The logout button posts to here. It calls AbandonSession to close the session object. If the visitor continues to browse the website, a new session is created.</dd>
